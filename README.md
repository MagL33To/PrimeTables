To run this code, clone the repository onto your local machine, build (with nuget package retrieval on) and run in a browser. This is a C# MVC project with a twitter bootstrap and angular front end.

I'm pleased with the simplicity of this app. I think that the requirements of the task were met with a good deal of code efficiency.

If I had more time, I would probably move the multiplication code onto the front-end as this would allow for even larger values to be calculated as the current version is limited by the maximum json character limit. I would also add unit tests for the front end code.
